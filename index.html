                Roses are red, violets are blue, and in between are a million
                other hues. But which one of these colors is, statistically
                speaking, the most popular around the world? The perception and
                categorization of colors, however, does seem to be fairly
                universal. In other words, language shapes the perception of
                reality. But that's not what the World Color Survey found.
                Instead, the survey found that across cultures, people tended to
                name hues the same way. So in this website, you can find the
                most popular color around the world. Enjoy!

            <h1>Blue</h1>
            <blockquote>
                There’s a good reason why most people say blue is their favorite
                color — it’s calming, soothing, and symbolizes the positive.
                Bright blues inspire ideas of loyalty, confidence, security, and
                reliable authority. Many companies and brands use these shades
                in their logos and messaging precisely because of these
                associations.
                <br /><br />
                As the color of the sky and the sea, blue is also used to imply
                a connection to nature. The turquoise shades you might see in
                the waters of the Caribbean Sea not only calm people but can
                also energize them. Light sky blue can make people feel
                contemplative and serene.

            <h1>Red</h1>
            <blockquote>
                Red has meanings on two different ends of the human emotional
                spectrum. It can symbolize passion and strength. There’s a
                reason why everything is red on Valentine’s Day — the color of
                love inspires people to strive for their romantic goals, for
                example.
                <br /><br />
                But it’s not all hugs and kisses. Red is also a symbol of wrath
                and danger. Angry people often say they see this color, plus the
                Stop sign is red as well. While red can be positive or negative,
                it’s definitely the color of action. Red gets people moving,
                whether it’s towards the target of their passion or away from a
                risky situation.

            <h1>Purple</h1>
            <blockquote>
                Purple is a rare color in nature, and for the longest time,
                purple dyes were extremely difficult and expensive to produce.
                As a result, only the wealthiest and most powerful people could
                afford it. To this day, we think of purple as the color of
                royalty and luxury. Consequently, it brings up a feeling of
                trust and reliability.
                <br /><br />
                Purple’s rarity also gives it an air of mystery. It’s associated
                with creativity and the realm of fantasy — think about how many
                times magic gets portrayed as purple in popular culture. Purple
                can also be an inspirational color that sparks the imagination
                and encourages us to try new things.

                Green is among the most multipurpose colors on the color wheel.
                It’s everywhere around us — in plants, money, foods, and even
                traffic lights. There’s a biological reason as well; the human
                eye can see more shades of green than any other color.
                <br /><br />
                Associated with nature and positivity, green can inspire
                feelings of harmony, growth, safety, and success. It’s also a
                calming color that makes people feel safe and comfortable. Green
                is one of the most popular colors, and it’s a safe choice as
                your design’s primary color.

                Black is a power color that adds gravity and strength to your
                message. Used sparingly, black can help your design look
                polished and minimal. Black backgrounds are an increasingly
                popular color choice in web design, but be careful that it
                doesn’t make your interface too dark and heavy.

                White often symbolizes simplicity, purity, and cleanliness.
                Often used to give contrast to your designs, white provides a
                clean, neutral slate that keeps you from crowding your design
                too much. “It’s there to give breathing room to other elements
                and to be a background to showcase something you want to bring
                more attention to,” says Ackerman.

                The color of sunshine, yellow brings about positive feelings.
                Joy, happiness, and hope are all within yellow’s domain. It can
                boost confidence, curiosity, and even improve learning. There’s
                just something about yellow that makes us think logically and
                positively.
                <br /><br />
                At the same time, though, yellow can cause anxious and
                uncomfortable feelings. A lot of yellow implies there’s risky
                business happening. Think about warning signs or potentially
                dangerous animals, like wasps. Both use yellow to tell you to
                keep your distance. It can also signify cowardice, hence the
                phrase “yellow-bellied.”

            <h1>Pink</h1>
            <blockquote>
                Once a color for boys, today pink is mainly associated with
                feminine traits. Soft and pastel pinks inspire feelings of
                kindness and compassion. Pink is a nurturing, playful, and
                nostalgic color that takes people back to their childhoods.
                <br /><br />
                That said, pink is a color of opposites since it can make us
                think of both innocence and burning passion. Bright and hot
                pinks are associated with love, romance, and even lust. Intense
                pinks create a sense of urgency. Because it has white mixed into
                it, though, pink doesn’t inspire the same kind of aggressive
                action as red.

                A mix of red and yellow, orange combines the passion of the
                former with the positivity of the latter. Bright and vibrant
                oranges are fun colors that burst with youthfulness, energy, and
                happiness. They inspire creativity and uplift people’s moods.
                Golden oranges also exude a sense of luxury and prestige.
                <br /><br />
                On the other hand, dark and almost brown, drab oranges — like
                decomposing autumn leaves — can elicit feelings of deceit or
                hopelessness. Even the energy of bright oranges can create ideas
                of impatience. These aren’t as common as the positive
                associations, but as a designer you should be aware of them.

                A true neutral shade, gray is almost always used as a secondary
                color or accent. It can be used to temper or complement any
                color, or to serve as a quiet background. Try not to block out
                your design in all gray, as that can tip the balance from
                neutral to dreary and boring.
